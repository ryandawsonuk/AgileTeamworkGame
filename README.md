# Agile Teamwork Game

Don't wait until contentious situations come up to get practice working through issues as a team.

Use this as a tool to be presented with scenarios and work through perspectives.

Disagreement is to be welcomed. In the real world compromises would have to be reached. Use that.

Based on the principles of 'The Five Dysfunctions of a Team' and observations about Scrum and Dark Scrum. Part of the aim is to challenge silos and role boundaries.

Scenarios are deliberately delicate. The idea is help teams get comfortable with acknowledging perspectives and working through disagreements. Especially disagreements close to the team's real work.
